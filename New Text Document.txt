Whenever a customer asks a question, the chatbot should first pre-process the question by removing unnecessary words and normalizing 
the format.It then needs to search through its database to find relevant information to answer the question. This involves implementing a 
scoring system to match the question's keywords and intent with existing data in the database.If the question has a high match score that crosses 
a predefined threshold like 0.6, this means there is enough information in the database to directly provide a good answer.However, 
if the question scores lower than the threshold value of 0.6 based on keyword and intent matching, the chatbot should admit it currently 
does not have sufficient information to fully address the customer's question.In this case, it should respond politely with the message: 
"Sorry, your question is not related to the area I am designed to support. Please ask the appropriate question so I can best assist you. Thank you!".
